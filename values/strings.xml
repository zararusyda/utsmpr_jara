            BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is
            a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit
            Entertainment.[5] The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V,
            and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop
            group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics,
            often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health,
            troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself,
            and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts
            and includes an alternative universe storyline.
